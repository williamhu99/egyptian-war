Instructions:
1) First install pygame by running 'pip3 install pygame' in terminal.
2) Read the rules.txt file to understand how to play.
3) Run 'python3 egyptianwar.py' and follow the steps there.
4) To replay the game, just repeat step 3.

To represent each card, I used a Python class to hold a rank and suit. The deck is represented by a list of cards that is shuffled using Python's random library. Each player's deck is a queue, in which the "top" card is popped off into the center pile, and future cards are added from the "bottom." In addition, I use the pygame library to read keyboard inputs in order to make the game more interactive.

While designing this game, I came across many edge cases. For example, I allow the user to exit the opening screen by pressing 'X' in order to read rules, but I had to make sure that the user doesn't accidentally press 'X' later and exit out of a game. In addition, players can slap whenever they choose, but I had to make sure that when searching for the patterns, there were enough cards in the center pile for each of the valid patterns.
